# flashcard-generator
This is a basic flashcard application.  The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.   Basic flashcards, which have a front ("Who was the first president of the United States?"), and a back ("George Washington"). Cloze-Deleted flashcards, which present partial text ("... was the first president of the United States."), and the full text when the user requests it ("George Washington was the first president of the United States.")

Instructions: 
1. set terminal directory to 'flashcard-generator' folder. 
2. type: node main.js basic/cloze (either basic or cloze depending on the type of flashcard you want)
3. enjoy the goodness!

If you want to add flashcards, navigate to the appropriate .txt file and add your flashcard in the following format (Question, Answer;)
